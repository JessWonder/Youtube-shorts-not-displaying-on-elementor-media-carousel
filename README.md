# Youtube-shorts-not-displaying-on-elementor-media-carousel
To solve the issue that youtube shorts added to elementor media carousel is not playing but only displayed as a image

This issue can be easily solved if it is due to a very small reason. 
In my senario, I added two youtube videos link to a web page by Elementor Pro Media Carousel but only one video can be displayed. The reason for the different result is one video is catagoried as Youtube shorts automatically once it is uploaded and the other video is just uploaded as a normal video. And the real situation is, the shorts video cannot be played properly on the website page.
The shorts video url is something like 'youtube.com/xxxx' and the normal video url is 'youtu.be/xxxx'.

To solve it in a simple way:
Get the proper/friendly url of the shorts video by right click on the shorts video page - then click 'copy video url'. In this way, you can get a youtu.be/xxx url and use it to embed the shorts on your elementor.
